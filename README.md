## 公式的运行和词汇语法重建

### 1. 公式的推导和基础运行

- 单词对称
- 排序不同

- f(x)=y

- 主语：是执行句子的行为或动作的主体
- 谓语：是对主语动作或状态的陈述或说明，指出“做什么”do what,“是什么”what is this或是“怎么样”how
- 宾语：又称受词，是指一个动作（动词）的接受


- 英语陈述语句：
`(状1) 主(定2) 谓(状2) （宾）（定2\状1）`

-中文陈述语句：
`(状1\定1) 主(状2) 谓(定2) （宾）（状1）`


I Love a girl
She died (没有宾语)
(You) come here


我爱你
去年（状1）我爱你
去年（状1）一个非常胖的（定1）胖丫头，非常热情的（状2）爱上了瘦瘦的(定2)你

插入语: ',"",~ 

- 英语：状语 主位语 状语
- 汉语：状语 主位语 状语

- 中文：修辞在前，重点在后（东方）
- 英文：修辞在后，重点在前（西方）

- 为什么？文化差异？
	+ 东方：农业文明（过程优先）
	+西方：商业文明（效率优先）


In your life(状1), **a friend** that is helpful **is** **a friend** that you should thank(状1).

主干体系：在你的一生当中，一个总能帮助你的朋友是一个应当感谢的朋友

在北京，没有钱的**年轻人**以这种方式也能**实现**他们心中的**梦想**。
在北京，年轻人没有钱的能实现以这种方式也他们心中的。

In Beijing, the young without money can realize in this way the dreams in their hearts.

**I** can **see** in his eyes the **love** to me
**I** can **see** in this picture profound **rules** in life

去年(状1)我(主)买了一块表
我(主)去年(状1)买了一块表

### 2.主干的定位
> 主干，一个哲学问题

- 主语：主体(名词，静态)
- 谓语：动作/行为（静态变成动态）
	+ (宾语)：行为接受对象(名词，静态)

#### 主干的定位
1. 主语：句首的**独立名词**性结构(名词 代词 分词(分身love, loved) 从句 it)

- 名词
	+ In his eyes, **Jack** is aliar. 
		* In his eyes 的 eyes 在介词，所以不是主语
- 分词
	+ **Living** in a city is always convenient. 

- 句子
	+ **That no one can live without water** is true. 

- 从句作为主语（that 开头）
	+ **It** is true that no one can live without water. 
		* it 是形式主语
		* it 指向 that no one can live without water. 逻辑主语

2. 谓语：排除过程
	+ 1. 从句中和介词短语中动词
		* The man who is smiling **is** jack. 正在笑得那个人是jack
	+ 2. 主语前动词
		* **In fighting**, the brave wins. 在战斗中，勇者获胜
	+ 3. 分词前无助词(have be)
		* I **am** working
		* I have **married**. I am **married**.
		* 分词：ing, ed => working, married

	+ 谓语可以是动词词组
		* I **want to see** you
		* I **want her to see** you

		* **The methods** that a community devises to perpetuate itself **come into being to** **preserve** of the cultural legacy that that community perceives as essential.
	
	+ GRE 考试

3. 宾语-谓语后的独立名词结构
- 宾语可以没有
- 句=主+谓
- He left.
- He is smart.

Althought not so reasouable, **a man** that is so weak in daily business **is** always **a loser** that can't fulfid his dreams in his life.

主干：a man is a loser


- 中文主干的寻找：
1. （你）不作死不会死。英文祈使句常省略主语 come here
2. 她很好 She is very good. 中文省略了谓语
3. （如果）山无棱天地合，（我）始敢于君绝。 英文必须有关联词
4. 我的英语是（被）体育老师传授的。省略了被动

### 3. 内部排序的运行算法-倒置逻辑
- I know the man who is singing. 我认识正在唱歌的那个人
- I know the man who is singing in the car. 我认识那个在车上正在唱歌的那个人
- I konw the man who is singing in the car that i bought last week.
我认识那个上周我买的车里唱歌的那个人
	+ the man => who is singing(doing) / in the car(where)
	+ in the car => i bought(doing) / last week(when)

- 排序：短语排序

### 短语的三种形式：**从句**
- 介词短语： in the car => (who is) in the car
- 从句： who is sing => singing
- 分词结构：singing

四级翻译：众说周知，杭州是在中国历史上被很多诗人赞美的城市。
As we all know, Hangzhou is a city that has been praised by many poets in the history of China.

For an action movie as big as The Expendable 3 with an all start cast so familiar to Chinese audience, a large promontional touar won't bring any extra benifits that they expect.

对于中国观众非常熟悉的由全明星阵容所扮演的敢死队3，这么大的动作电影来说，一个大规模的促销旅行并不会带来他们所期待的任何好处。


###　语法重建第一集：名词的世界
１. 数量问题：可数和不可数 
- 固定单位：a cup of water

- Fish: 即可数不可数
	+ 鱼：可数
	+ 鱼肉：不可数
- sheep：一词不固定
- time：单位不固定
- Coffee / tea: a cup of coffee => a coffee
- Paper
	+ 纸张：不可数
	+ 卷子：固定单位
	+ 论文：固定单位
- Experience:
	+ 经历：可数
	+ 经验：不可数
- Glass：
	+ 玻璃：不可数
	+ 眼睛：可数
-即可数又不可数：hair,corn, grass, popcorn, rice, salt, sand, snow, sugar

2. 就近和就远原则（扯淡）

- 就远
	+ A woman with two children (is) comming.
	+ I was well as they (am) ready to help you

- 就近
	+ Not only I but also he (is) right.
	+ Both I and he (are) right.
	+ Neither you nor I (am) fit for the work.
	+ (Are) neither you nor I fit for the work?
	+ There (is) a pencil and two pens in the pencil box.

- 主语中心原则
- There be 唯一没有主语

3. 集合名词的数量逻辑
- family Class cattle group

- 我家很有钱 My family is rich
- 我家都疯了 My family are mad
